XADisk-spring
=============

XADisk integration with Spring Transaction Management ala Hibernate

Objective is to integrate XASession into classical Spring Transaction Manager under the hood and leave spring users only with configuration problems and use a factory to retrieve XASession


TODO:

* Handle Exception Correctly so users get cool message and no "RuntimeException"
 
* Separate XADiskSessionFactory with others class as they are just test / examples.
 
* Make more examples.
